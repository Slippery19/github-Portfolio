                <img src="images/image1.jpg" title="Profile Picture">

        <p>Hi, im Gbadebo Dominion Teniola, a multi-skilled creative with a passion
             for turning ideas into impact. From crafting websites and UI designs to
              decoding trading strategies and market patterns, I thrive at the intersection
               of logic and creativity. Whether Iâ€™m analyzing charts or building a slick
                frontend, Iâ€™m always exploring smarter and easier ways to solve real problems.

            I believe in clean code, clean design, and clear goals.

            <h2>ðŸ”™ Past</h2>
            <h3>ðŸ’» Tech Journey</h3>
            <p>I got introduced to programming at age 12, starting with a simple calculator in 
                Visual Basic. That early spark led me to explore more, from helping my brother 
                build a 3D game in Unity, to developing a business website for my mom. Iâ€™ve always
                enjoyed diving into new tools and ideas, experimenting with different projects
                across web development, design, and functionality. Every challenge taught me
                something new.
            </p>

            <h3>ðŸ“ˆ Trading Journey</h3> 
            <p>At age 14, I was introduced to the world of Forex trading. I began by learning the
                fundamentals, key terms, trading psychology, and how the market moves. Over time,
                I explored and practiced several strategies, especially Support & Resistance,
                Turtle Soup (ICT), and Smart Money Concepts (SMC). This hands-on experience
                    helped me understand market structure, liquidity, and how to approach trading
                    with logic and patience.
            </p>
        </div>
         <div class="container">
            <h2>ðŸ§  Present</h2>
            <p>Right now, Iâ€™m focused on sharpening my JavaScript skills â€” learning
                 the language in depth to build smarter, more dynamic web projects. 
                 Itâ€™s part of my commitment to mastering the fundamentals and leveling
                  up my development game.</p>
                  <p>
                    At the same time, Iâ€™m actively refining my Forex trading strategy, with a strong focus
                    on Smart Money Concepts (SMC). Iâ€™m studying market structure, improving trade 
                    execution, and reviewing past trades to build consistency and discipline. Itâ€™s all
                    about precision, patience, and progress.
            </p>
        </div>
         <div class="container">
            <h2>ðŸš€ Future</h2>
            <p>Looking ahead, Iâ€™m working towards landing freelance opportunities with
                 reputable companies, where I can apply my growing skill set and build
                  a strong professional track record. Iâ€™m also aiming to become a
                   funded trader, sharpening my strategy and discipline to meet the
                    standards of top prop firms.
            </p>
            <p>
                While I havenâ€™t fully decided on the exact tech specialization I want to focus on,
                Iâ€™m actively exploring different paths â€” from web development to game dev and beyond 
                to find what truly resonates. For now, Iâ€™m committed to learning, improving, and 
                staying consistent in both tech and trading.
